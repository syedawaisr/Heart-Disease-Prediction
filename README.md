# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end project for heart disease prediction using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks (NN), and Random Forest.

## Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3.11 venv
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use the following command to download all project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Model Training:**

   Run the `training.py` file within the `src/components` directory to train the model and save it in the artifact folder:

   ```bash
   python src/components/training.py
   ```

4. **Running the Application:**

   Once the training is completed, run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the site by checking the browser's local host address ([http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)).

5. **Making Predictions:**

   Now you can substitute values and predict the output.
